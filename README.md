## Overview

This project tries to explore different strategies to help people generate more yield for their crypto assets. The first strategy I developed is a yearn strategy based on Idle for lusd, which does not have much yield strategy. I developed a badger strategy based on Compound for WBTC by leveraging collateral to earn more yield. I also cloned the badger strategy to a Stakedao strategy. Moreover, I added Nexus Mutual, element, pods and 88mph connectors to Instadapp, which is a helpful platform to help developers quickly create new strategy for Defi protocol.
